# GridWorld-MDP-Simulator
The GridWorld MDP Simulator is a Python-based implementation of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) designed to simulate an agent's navigation through a grid environment. This project provides a foundational platform for studying reinforcement learning algorithms and understanding the mechanics of MDPs.
Project Objective:
The objective of the GridWorld MDP Simulator is to provide a simple yet flexible environment for experimenting with MDPs and reinforcement learning algorithms. It can be extended to include more complex dynamics, additional actions, and varying reward structures, making it a valuable tool for both educational purposes and research in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
